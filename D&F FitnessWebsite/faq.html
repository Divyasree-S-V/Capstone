      <h2>Q: What is BMI?</h2>
  <h4>A: BMI is a measurement of a person's body fat based on their weight and height.
It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.</h4>

<h2>Q: What is a "healthy" BMI range?
<h4>A: A healthy BMI range is generally considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.</h4>

<h2>Q: What does it mean if my BMI is below the healthy range?</h2>
<h4>A: If your BMI is below the healthy range, it may indicate that you are underweight and could benefit from gaining some weight.
However, it's important to talk to a healthcare provider to determine whether your weight is healthy for your body type.</h4>

<h2>Q: What does it mean if my BMI is above the healthy range?</h2>
<h4>A: If your BMI is above the healthy range, it may indicate that you are overweight or obese, which can increase your risk for
certain health conditions.
However, BMI is not always an accurate indicator of health, so it's important to talk to a healthcare provider to determine if
your weight is healthy for your body type.</h4>

<h2>Q: Are there any limitations to using BMI as a measure of body fat?</h2>
<h4>A: Yes, BMI has some limitations. It does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, or body composition,
so it may not be an accurate measurement for athletes, bodybuilders, or people with a lot of muscle mass.
Additionally, BMI may not be as accurate for people who are very short or very tall.</h4>
